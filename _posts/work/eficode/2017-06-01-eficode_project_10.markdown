Implemented a new version for customerâ€™s mobile testing cloud. The previous version had been implemented purely on Jenkins and was lacking a proper UI. For the new version we implemented an UI which visualized the different test projects and statuses of the phones connected to the system. The backend was implemented using Python and Django framework and frontend was implemented using React. In addition, we created shared libraries for Jenkins which allowed the usage of the mobile testing cloud together with Jenkins Pipelines. The software was run on Openshift Container Platform.
