I was given a speech on title: "Robot Framework with a real Robot". The presentation was about a project I did at Eficode together with NETS which is leading provider of payments, card and information services in Nordic. The presentation showed how Robot Framework can be used to test also embedded software. How RF can be used to press real buttons with a real robot and how to read the screen using computer vision.
