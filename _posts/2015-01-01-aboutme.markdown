Entrepreneur, private pilot, M.Sc. and a diehard can-do person with international experience from devops and startups. Constantly exploring and experimenting and always learning new stuff. I like building things, from surfboards to CNC milling machines and if something breaks, I'll always find a way to fix it. On my spare time I like to perfect my skills on making Neapolitan pizzas.
