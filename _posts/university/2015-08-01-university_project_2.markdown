CNC machine built from scratch. 3­-axis, 1.5x1.2x1m steel/aluminum frame. Stepper motors on each axis and water cooled spindle. Will be used for milling MDF and small aluminum parts. Made especially for making molds for competition grade radio controlled model airplanes. Total weight 165kg and had to make myself a loft bed in order to accommodate this in my apartment.
