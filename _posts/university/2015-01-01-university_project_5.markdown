Worked as a project leader in a project where we developed software for collectin weather data from sensor nodes using Parrot AR.Drone. Sensor nodes were equipped with low power radio transmitters and parrot drone had a radio receiver. When drone was flown on top of a sensor node, it collected node data and transmitted it to the mobile device over Wi-Fi. Native Android App was developed for data visualization.
